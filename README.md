This project was to make a website for the SNHU's travel team for the top 5 destinations. Once a location was selected, 
it would open an external website to give the user more information about that area. I did really well with being able to attach external websites into my code
to allow the user to obtain more information.  If I wanted to enhance my code, I could make it so that more locations had the ability to open external websites. 
If the user did not want to go to one of the top 5 destinations, they would be able to get more information through our website. 
At first, adding those websites was the most challenging. I thought that I would be able to just type something like wwww.google.com/Maui and it would work. 
Once I came to the realization after my code kept erroring out, I went and researched sites of those 5 areas and imported the entire website. 
Those same skills I found challenging and what I did really well at will be valuable to me in other projects and course work. I am sure it will come up again either through 
school or my professional life that I will have to create something like this. I made this program readable by putting in notes so anyone reading my code would be able to understand what my code was trying to do. It is also adaptable because if you wanted to change the travel destinations there is only a small portion of the code that would 
need to be changed.
